You are a senior frontend engineer and motion designer.
Build a production-ready, single-page Valentine webapp using Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
This app is meant to be sent to my girlfriend and should feel playful, cute, and premium.
It must be deployable to Vercel immediately.

USER CONTENT
- My name: Bank
- Girlfriend name: Tawan
- Date label: 14 Feb 2026 (you can hardcode)
- Tone: playful (ขี้เล่น), cute, warm, not cringe
- Main message 
  "Happy Valentine's Day, Tawan 💖 I made this for you. Hope you like it."
- Promise line: "จริงทุกๆวันก็เป็นวันแห่งความรักนะ คึตึ"

TECH STACK / CONSTRAINTS
- Next.js 15+ App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- lucide-react (optional)
- Use next/font: Poppins for UI + Playfair Display for headline (or similar)
- Single page only: app/page.tsx as main route
- No backend, no external APIs
- Must run: npm install && npm run dev
- Must build: npm run build
- Must be ready for Vercel deploy, no TODOs

DESIGN / UX REQUIREMENTS
1) HERO (full screen)
- Gradient background (romantic but playful)
- Big headline: "Happy Valentine's Day, Tawan 💖"
- Subline: "From Bank" + date chip "14 Feb 2026"
- Primary CTA button: "Open my heart 💌" → smooth scroll to next section
- Add small floating hearts in background (subtle)

2) FLOWERS (MUST HAVE)
- Add an animated flower/petal system across the whole page:
  - Prefer Canvas petals OR lightweight DOM petals (no heavy libs)
  - Petals drift/fall slowly, random size/rotation, gentle blur
- Also include a bouquet / flower card illustration:
  - Use inline SVG bouquet OR CSS flower shapes
  - Place it in a “Gift” card section

3) MEMORIES SECTION
- Use 5 memory cards with playful styling
- Animate in on scroll (staggered)
- Each card has an emoji/icon + short text

4) LOVE LETTER SECTION
- A paper-like letter card with subtle grain texture (CSS)
- Include:
  "Happy Valentine's Day, Tawan 💖 I made this for you. Hope you like it."
  plus 1–2 Thai playful lines (write them naturally)
  then sign: "— Bank"
- Add typewriter effect for the first line only.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: if reduced, show text instantly.

5) INTERACTIVE SURPRISE (CUTE)
- Add a playful interaction:
  Option A (recommended): "Will you be my Valentine?" with Yes/No buttons.
    - No button dodges the cursor/tap playfully (but still accessible: allow long-press or a secondary link that triggers acceptance for keyboard users)
    - Yes triggers:
      - confetti burst (lightweight canvas particles)
      - modal overlay with bouquet animation
      - message: "เย้! รักเธอนะ Tawan 💖"
      - a button: "Close (still love you)" to dismiss
- Make it mobile-friendly (No button dodges within bounds)

6) FINALE
- Big line: "I choose you, everyday."
- Soft glow, floating hearts/petals continue
- Footer: "Made with love by Bank 💗"

ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS (Framer Motion)
- Page load: hero elements stagger in
- Scroll: sections whileInView with once:true
- Background: petals drift continuously (requestAnimationFrame if canvas)
- Modal: spring animation

ACCESSIBILITY / PERFORMANCE
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Ensure readable contrast
- Use semantic HTML, buttons, aria-labels
- Keep assets minimal and inline (SVG)
- Avoid huge dependencies
